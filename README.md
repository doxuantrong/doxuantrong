- Hi, I'm Do Xuan Trong, I'm from Vietnam.
- I am interested in Mathematics and Programming.
- Currently, I am a student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST).
- You can read my MATHEMATICS blog at https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c975970. I created it since I was a high school student (it's almost about Inequalities).
